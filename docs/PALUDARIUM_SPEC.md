# Paludarium — Habitat Pack Spec

The merge habitat. It is only "free" in the sense that both parent techs
already ship: the **aquarium** owns water, caustics, surface, motes, shafts,
bubbles, boid swimming; the **terrarium** owns soil, plants, branches,
crawl/climb/hop locomotion, humidity/dirty-glass meters. Paludarium is those
two packs rendered in one glass box with a waterline drawn between them, plus
exactly one genuinely new idea — **agents that cross the waterline** — and two
absorbed sub-concepts the roadmap folded in: **Pond** (koi, turtles,
tadpole→frog) and **Crabitat** (land hermit crabs that swap shells).

Everything here maps to an existing module. New code is: one waterline shader
mask, one `amphibious` locomotion state machine, a metamorphosis builder-swap
hook, and a shell-swap item system. Sized for John's S24 baseline at 60 fps —
and this is the one habitat that renders BOTH parent scenes at once, so §8 is
written honestly, not optimistically.

---

## 1. Enclosure rendering (split-world reuse of `src/tank.js` + terrarium env)

`buildPaludarium(scene, renderer)` returns the same handle shape as
`buildTank()` — `{ group, setTheme(type), setDay(df), update(t) }` — so
`main.js` swaps it in without touching the frame loop.

The world is one `TANK`-sized glass box (keep `W:122, H:61, D:61`), split by a
horizontal **waterline** at `WATER_LINE = TANK.H * WATER_FRAC`. Below the line
is verbatim aquarium; above and behind is verbatim terrarium; the line itself
is the new tech.

```js
// paludarium constants (pack data after the split)
WATER_FRAC = 0.40,                    // waterline at 40% of interior height
WATER_LINE = TANK.H * 0.40,           // = 24.4 cm  (aquarium WATER_LEVEL was 55)
BEACH_X = 18,                         // land shelf begins at x > +18 (a sloped bank)
```

The land is not the whole top — it is a **sloped bank** rising out of the water
on one side (positive-x third of the footprint), so the scene reads as a shore,
not a layer cake. The substrate plane is displaced: flat-and-low under the
water (sand bed) ramping up through a wet beach into a planted dry bank.

| Aquarium element (`tank.js`) | Paludarium use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sand bed (`PlaneGeometry` + dune noise) | **Full-footprint terrain**, one plane | Same displaced plane, but the displacement adds a ramp: `y += smoothstep(0, BEACH_X, x) * BANK_H`. Underwater portion tinted `sand`; wet-beach band mixes `sand`→`soil`; dry bank is `soil`/`soilDark` (terrarium colors). One mesh, one draw call. |
| Water surface plane (`surfGeo` @ `WATER_LEVEL`) | **Kept, lowered to `WATER_LINE`, clipped to x < BEACH_X** | Same `surfMat` ripple `onBeforeCompile`. From above it is the pond surface; from the side it is the top of the waterline. Its edge where it meets the bank is the shoreline — feather its opacity to 0 across the wet-beach band so there's no hard cut. |
| Caustics shader on sand | **Kept, underwater only** | Same additive quad at `y=1.2`, but its plane is scaled/positioned to cover only x < BEACH_X. Free — it was always a screen-cheap additive pass. |
| Back wall (`BackSide` box) | **Split-tinted back wall** | Same dark box; the `setTheme` deep-color tint applies below `WATER_LINE`, cork-bark brown above. Achieved with the same world-Y shader mask used for agents (below), not a second mesh. |
| `buildShafts()` sun shafts | Kept, underwater only, warmer | Sit below `WATER_LINE`; shorten to `WATER_LINE - 6`. Above water they'd read wrong. |
| `buildBubbles()` airstone | Kept, pops at `WATER_LINE` | One-line change: wrap height `TANK.WATER_LEVEL` → `WATER_LINE`. |
| `buildMotes()` marine snow | Underwater motes + a few land dust motes | Split the point cloud: 70% below the line drifting up (marine snow), 30% above drifting sideways (terrarium dust). Same single `Points` system, seed-partitioned. |
| Glass frame (`addFrame`) | Identical | `TANK` dims unchanged. |
| Decor (`buildDecor`) | Aquatic + terrestrial | Below line: rocks, a driftwood root, aquatic plant blades (reuse). Above line: broad-leaf plants, a branch or two over the water (archerfish targets — see §6), a basking rock at the shoreline (turtle haul-out). All reuse existing `buildDecor` primitives. |

### 1.1 The waterline itself (the new tech — chosen approach)

Three candidate techniques were weighed for a phone GPU:

| Approach | Cost | Half-submerged look | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Clip planes** (render each crossing agent twice — dry copy clipped `y>line`, wet copy clipped `y<line`) | 2× draw calls per crossing agent + clip-plane state changes; WebGL clipping adds discards | Correct | ❌ Doubles the exact draw calls we can least afford (agents), and only for the few that cross. |
| **Two-material volume** (a translucent water box; refraction) | Depth sort + transparency overdraw over the whole lower half; refraction is a second pass | Approximate, expensive | ❌ Overdraw is the phone killer; we already avoid a water *volume* in the aquarium for this reason (it uses fog, not a box). |
| **World-Y shader mask** (one global `uWaterY` uniform; every material's fragment shader tints/darkens fragments below it, brightens a thin meniscus band) | ~6–8 ALU per fragment, **single pass, zero extra draw calls** | Free and correct: a fish half-out has its lower half water-tinted and its upper half dry-lit in the same draw | ✅ **CHOSEN.** |

**Chosen: the world-Y shader mask.** One uniform `uWaterY` (world space) is
injected into every agent, terrain, plant, and back-wall material via a shared
`onBeforeCompile` chunk (the same pattern `tank.js` already uses to inject the
ripple `time` uniform). In the fragment shader, using the world position
varying:

```glsl
// shared chunk appended to every pack material's fragment shader
uniform float uWaterY;        // WATER_LINE in world space
uniform float uCausticT;      // time, for underwater shimmer on submerged agents
varying vec3 vWorldPos;
// ... near the end, before gl_FragColor is finalized:
float below = step(vWorldPos.y, uWaterY);
float band  = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.0, 1.2, abs(vWorldPos.y - uWaterY));  // meniscus
// underwater: cool tint + darken + faint caustic shimmer
vec3 wet = mix(gl_FragColor.rgb, gl_FragColor.rgb * vec3(0.55,0.78,0.85), 0.6);
wet += 0.10 * below * sin(vWorldPos.x*0.6 + uCausticT) * sin(vWorldPos.z*0.6 + uCausticT*0.9);
gl_FragColor.rgb = mix(gl_FragColor.rgb, wet, below);
// meniscus: a bright refraction lip right at the line
gl_FragColor.rgb += band * vec3(0.9,1.0,1.0) * 0.18;
```

- **Half-submerged rendering is automatic**: a mudskipper with its head in air
  and tail in water gets a dry-lit head and a water-tinted tail in a single
  draw, because the split is per-fragment on world-Y, not per-object.
- **The meniscus line on the glass**: the same `band` term, evaluated on the
  back wall and on a thin inward-facing ring at `y=WATER_LINE` on the four glass
  panes (reuse `addFrame`'s bar helper to lay a 0.3 cm emissive-ish band at the
  waterline), gives the wet lip where water meets glass — the detail that sells
  "there is water here" from the side.
- The existing ripple **surface plane** still provides the animated top-down
  water and the specular glint; the mask provides the side-on tint and the
  meniscus. They are complementary, not redundant.

Cost of the mask: one extra `varying vec3 vWorldPos` and ~8 ALU per fragment on
materials that opt in. No new draw calls, no depth pre-pass, no clip state. This
is the cheapest of the three and the only one that gives correct half-submerged
agents for free — the deciding factor on a phone GPU.

Theme entry (`WATER_THEMES`/terrarium `themes` sibling; becomes per-pack
`themes` after the split):

```js
palud: {
  // underwater half (from fresh theme, warmed slightly for a planted look)
  fogColor: 0x123f37, fogDensity: 0.0030,   // fog only fills the lower half visually
  deep: 0x0d332c, tint: 0x2a6e5e,
  sand: 0xb99a6b, sandDark: 0x8a6f4a, surface: 0x9fd8c8,
  // land half (from terra theme)
  soil: 0x4a3520, soilDark: 0x2e2012, bank: 0x5a4a30,
  // shared
  lightColor: 0xfff2dc, lightIntensity: 1500, ambient: 0x3d5240,
  waterY: 24.4, meniscus: 0xdff4ff,
}
```

## 2. Care model mapping (reuse `CareSim` in `src/sim.js`)

`CareSim._decay()` already runs everything; the question is **how many meters a
6-year-old should juggle**. A paludarium plausibly wants BOTH aquarium water
quality (fish, koi, turtles are messy) AND terrarium humidity (frogs, land
crabs). That is a real husbandry fact and a real UX hazard: three-plus decaying
bars is where "calm pet" becomes "chore app."

| Aquarium/terra meter | Paludarium meter | Mechanics |
|---|---|---|
| `tank.water` (quality 1→0) | **Water quality** | Unchanged from aquarium: bioload + uneaten food drive it down, filtration recovers it, `waterChange()` +0.55. Fish/koi/turtles below `SICK_THRESHOLD` take the existing health-drain path. |
| `tank.algae` (0→1) | **Dirty glass** | Unchanged: the existing wipe gesture (`sim.scrubAlgae`) clears front-pane grime. Grows a touch faster (more light on a planted shore). |
| Terrarium `humidity` | **Humidity — DERIVED, not a chore** (recommended) | Because there is standing water, humidity is *supplied by the pond*. Model it as a **readout driven by water level + a misting top-up**, not an independent decaying bar: `humidity = clamp(0.55 + 0.4*waterFillFrac - dryPenalty)`. Land species have a comfort band (`humidity` field) exactly as terrarium; it only dips below comfort if the kid lets the *water* crash. This folds the second husbandry axis into the water meter they already tend. |

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — how many meters.** Three real options, and this is the
> single most important taste call in the pack:
> - (a) **Two meters + derived humidity (RECOMMENDED).** Kid tends *water
>   quality* and *dirty glass* — the same two they already know from the
>   aquarium. Humidity is a green/amber readout that only complains when the
>   water is neglected. One mental model, land and water share a fate. Calm.
> - (b) **Three independent meters** (water, humidity via misting, glass).
>   Husbandry-accurate, but it's the first habitat to ask a kid to keep three
>   bars up, and the mist ritual competes with the water-change ritual. Risks
>   the "too many chores" cliff HABITAT_VISION explicitly warns against.
> - (c) **One unified "Habitat health"** rolling water+humidity+glass into a
>   single bar. Maximally calm, but throws away the cause-and-effect teaching
>   that is the whole educational point.
>
> My read: **(a)**. It keeps the aquarium's two-meter muscle memory, honors the
> real biology (a paludarium *is* humid because it's half water), and never
> makes the kid tend three decaying bars.

`applyOffline()` loops the paludarium's tank(s) exactly as it loops
`['fresh','salt']` today — no change; offline decay hits water quality and the
land species inherit the derived-humidity consequence for free.

`rules.js` `evaluateAdd()` runs **unchanged**. `water !== current` becomes the
habitat-match check (`'palud'` blocks fish-only species and vice versa —
though see the crossover DECISION in §6). `bioload` = combined enclosure space.
`predator`/`canEat` already covers the spicy interactions (turtle eats small
fish, archerfish eats bugs, pacman-style frogs) — see §6. `soloOnly` covers a
lone turtle. No new rule code required for MVP.

## 3. Foods (aquatic + terrestrial coexisting)

Food gains a `behavior` strategy (the split already planned this in
`ENGINE_SPLIT.md` §1 for `food.js`: `sink | hop | static | drip`). The
paludarium is the first pack where **both** water foods and land foods are on
the menu at once, and the new wrinkle is **cross-boundary drift**: fish food
dropped over the beach, or a cricket that hops into the water.

| id | name | emoji | behavior | eaten by | when it lands wrong |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `flake` | Flakes | 🍥 | `sink` (existing float→sink) | fish, koi, tadpoles, fry | **On the beach:** doesn't sink — sits as wet debris. Beach foragers (mudskipper, fiddler crab, hermit crab) *can* eat it; otherwise it rots and dings water quality when the tide/rain washes it back (see DECISION). |
| `pellet` | Sinking Pellets | 🟤 | `sink` fast | koi, turtles, bottom fish | On beach: same as flake — forageable or rots. |
| `turtlestick` | Turtle Sticks | 🥢 | `float` then slow sink | turtles, koi, archerfish (from the surface) | Floats at the waterline — the turtle surfaces to grab it. Great "come up for air" beat. |
| `cricket` | Crickets | 🦗 | `hop` (terrarium hop-arc mini-agent) | frogs, toads, mudskipper, crabs, newt | **Hops into the water:** becomes a struggling swimmer at the surface — archerfish/fish snap it, or a frog grabs it. Emergent and true. |
| `worm` | Bloodworms / Mealworms | 🪱 | `sink` in water / `static` on land | almost everyone | Dual-natured: the aquatic worm sinks (existing `frozen`), the land worm wiggles in place. Same id, behavior chosen by where it lands. |
| `veggie` | Greens | 🥬 | `static` | koi, turtles, fiddler crabs, hermit crabs, tadpoles (algae phase) | Sits on land or sinks slowly in water; both halves' herbivores browse it. |

The `FoodSystem.update` per-item strategy keys off `FOODS[type].behavior`, and
each item checks its own `y` vs `uWaterY` each frame to decide land-rules vs
water-rules — the mask uniform is reused as sim data, not just a shader input.
`nearestFor`/`eat`/rot accounting are unchanged from `food.js`.

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — fish food on the beach.** (a) **Forageable** — beach
> critters (mudskipper, crabs) eat stranded fish food; nothing is wasted, and it
> teaches "the shore has its own cleanup crew." (b) **Wasted & rots** — misplaced
> food sits, rots, dings water quality; teaches *aim your feeding* (matches the
> aquarium's uneaten-food pollution lesson). (c) **Can't drop there** — the feed
> tool only drops over water; land species are fed from a separate land-feed tap.
> Recommend (a): it makes the mudskipper and crabs feel purposeful and keeps the
> tone forgiving, with a small rot penalty if nothing eats it within the window.

## 4. Locomotion — amphibious agents (the one new movement system)

Four locomotion names already exist or are trivially reused: `swim` (aquarium),
`crawl`/`climb` (terrarium, verbatim for crabs), `hopper` (terrarium),
`serpent` (unused here). The **new** thing is `amphibious`: an agent that owns
two of the above sub-modes and switches between them at the waterline.

### 4.1 The amphibious state machine

An `amphibious` agent declares `waterMode` and `landMode` (each one of the
existing locomotion modules) plus a driver that decides which side of the line
it wants to be on. `Swarm.update` dispatches to the active sub-module exactly as
the locomotion registry (`ENGINE_SPLIT.md` §3) dispatches any mode; the
amphibious wrapper only owns the transition.

```
                 wantsLand (bask / forage / flee-to-shore / random haul-out)
   [WATER: waterMode] ───────────────► [APPROACH_SHORE] ──► [EMERGE] ──► [LAND: landMode]
        ▲                                                                      │
        │                          wantsWater (cool off / hunger in water /    │
        └────────── [SUBMERGE] ◄── [APPROACH_WATER] ◄────── flee-to-water /────┘
                                                            random dive)
```

- **WATER**: runs `waterMode` (`swim`) with the boid/zone code unchanged, but Y
  is clamped to `< WATER_LINE`.
- **wantsLand triggers** (any true → target the nearest shoreline point):
  baskNeed rising (turtle, warmed by day factor), hunger with food only on land,
  a predator in the water, or a random haul-out timer (turtles/mudskippers do
  this for no reason and it's charming).
- **APPROACH_SHORE**: steer toward the nearest terrain point where
  `terrainY ≈ WATER_LINE` (the shoreline set, precomputed from the displaced
  plane). Still swimming.
- **EMERGE** (0.3 s): a short scripted clamber — Y lerps from `WATER_LINE` up
  the bank, body pitches nose-up, gait crossfades swim→land. The world-Y mask
  makes the half-out-of-water look free during this beat.
- **LAND**: runs `landMode` (`crawl` for turtle/crab/mudskipper, `hopper` for
  frog/toad/newt) with Y pinned to `terrainY` and the terrarium wall/branch
  surfaces available if the mode is a climber.
- **wantsWater triggers**: baskNeed satisfied, hunger with food only in water,
  a land threat (tap-startle on land), a random dive timer, or (mudskipper)
  drying out — a `wetness` value that falls on land and forces a return.
- **SUBMERGE** (0.25 s): slide down the bank, pitch nose-down, crossfade to
  swim.

Per-species tuning of the same machine:

| Species | waterMode | landMode | Driver character |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Red-eared slider** (turtle) | `swim` (bottom/all zone) | `crawl` (slow, `tortoise`-speed) | Long basks on the shore rock when day factor is high; dives to feed. The archetypal amphibian beat. |
| **Fire-bellied toad** | `swim` (paddling, shallow) | `hopper` | Spends "as much time paddling as hopping" (its real fact) — short random cross timers both ways, stays near the shoreline. |
| **Mudskipper** (the mascot) | `swim` (darty, surface) | `crawl` (pectoral-fin "skitter", `crab`-fast) — **a fish that walks out** | `wetness` driver: crawls out to forage/bask, must return before drying; can climb the low glass a little (reuse climber glue). |
| **Newt** | `swim` | `crawl` (salamander gait) | Seasonal-ish: biased to water when young/hungry, land when resting. |
| **Frog (tree/pond)** | `swim` (brief) | `hopper` (+ branch perch) | Mostly land/branch; dives only when startled or to lay (breeding). |

Crabs (**fiddler**, **land hermit**) are **not** amphibious agents — they are
terrarium `crawler`/`climber` verbatim, living on the beach and bank, dipping a
claw in the shallows for humidity but never swimming. Zero new movement code.
Koi and archerfish are **pure `swim`** (aquarium agents) that never leave the
water — the amphibious system is opt-in per species, not imposed on the pack.

### 4.2 Tadpole → frog metamorphosis (reuses `f.growth`, swaps the BUILDER)

This is the Pond concept and the retention loop made structural. A tadpole is a
plain `swim` agent with `archetype:'tadpole'`. It grows via the **existing**
`f.growth` path in `CareSim._decay` (`SIM.GROW_DAYS`, fed + healthy). The new
hook: at a growth **threshold**, the agent's *builder and locomotion change* —
it does not just scale up.

```js
// in CareSim._decay, alongside the existing growth block:
const META = 0.6;                                  // metamorphosis threshold
if (f.metamorph && (f.growth ?? 1) >= META && !f.metamorphed) {
  f.metamorphed = true;
  f.sp = f.metamorph;                              // 'tadpole_frog' -> 'fire_bellied_toad'
  this.events.push({ type: 'metamorphose', id: f.id, from: 'tadpole', to: f.sp, name: f.name });
}
```

`main.js` handles the `metamorphose` event the way it handles `death`/`birth`:
dispose the tadpole `Object3D`, build the adult via `buildAgentVisual(newSpec)`,
hand the new visual to the *same* `Agent.instId` but re-init its locomotion from
`swim` to `amphibious` (`hopper` landMode). Growth continues from `META`→1 as a
juvenile frog. Stages, all from one growth scalar:

| `f.growth` | Stage | Builder / locomotion | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.10–0.35 | Tadpole | `tadpole` swim | Round body, big tail, no legs |
| 0.35–0.60 | Legged tadpole | `tadpole` swim (leg buds) | Back legs sprout (shader/morph, cheap) |
| **0.60** | **Metamorphosis** | swim → amphibious(hopper) | Builder swap event; tail resorbs |
| 0.60–1.0 | Juvenile frog | amphibious | Grows to adult size normally |

The intermediate leg-bud visual is a cheap tweak of the tadpole model (a couple
of scaled cylinders faded in by `growth`), not a third builder — only the
0.60 swap is a real builder change. This reuses the exact growth machinery koi
and every fish already use; the only additions are one threshold check and one
event type.

> the shop; they metamorphose into the frog you paid for — simplest, the

> deepest loop, a real "my frogs had babies AND they changed shape" moment. (c)
> **Both**: buy your first, breed thereafter. Recommend (a) for MVP (proves the
> builder-swap), (c) as the full Pond experience.

## 5. Hermit-crab shell-swap mechanic (the Crabitat concept)

Land hermit crabs live in borrowed shells and **trade up as they grow**. Shells
are collectible items in the world, tied to `f.growth`, and the kid can drop new
ones in. Concretely:

### 5.1 Shells as items

Shells are props managed like food items but persistent (they don't get eaten or
rot). Each shell has a `size` (small/medium/large/jumbo) and an `occupied` flag.

```js
// shell item: { mesh, size: 0..3, occupied: bool, ownerId: instId|null }
```

- A hermit crab spec carries `shellUser: true` and a `shellSize` on its record
  (starts matching its juvenile `growth`).
- The crab's **rendered shell** is one of the `invertbuilder` `crab` group's
  parts (the `sph`/`coil` shell already modeled for snails is reused as the
  hermit's borrowed shell), scaled to `shellSize`.

### 5.2 Trading up (ties into `f.growth`)

The crab grows via the normal `f.growth` path. When its body outgrows its shell
(`growth` crosses the next size band and `shellSize < needed`), it enters a
**house-hunting** state:

```
growth crosses band → needsShell=true → seek nearest EMPTY shell of size >= needed
   found within reach → [SWAP animation ~1s] → old shell drops (occupied=false),
   crab adopts new shell (shellSize=new, needsShell=false)
   none available → crab is "cramped": a gentle nag (crab pauses, tugs at its
      shell) + a HUD hint "Your hermit crab needs a bigger shell!" — husbandry,
      not punishment. No health hit unless left cramped for days.
```

- **Swap animation**: crab backs out of the old shell (body briefly bare and
  vulnerable — a genuine surprise beat, §7), scuttles to the new one, reverses
  in. Reuses the `crawler` orient/scuttle code; the "bare" moment is just the
  shell part hidden for ~1 s.
- **Old shell** stays in the world as an empty collectible — a smaller crab can
  later claim it (the real biology of a shell exchange chain, and the "line up
  biggest-to-smallest" fact becomes an emergent scene if you have several).

### 5.3 Kid drops new shells

A **Shell** tool sits beside the food tools: tapping drops an empty shell of a
chosen size onto the beach (same drop path as food, `behavior:'static'`). This
is the kid's lever to keep crabs housed as they grow — a care action that isn't
a decaying meter, which fits the calm brief.

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — shell supply.** (a) **Free shells** from the Shell tool,
> unlimited — never a dead end, pure toy. (b) **Bought shells** (a few coins
> each) — a small economy sink, teaches "your growing pet needs new things." (c)
> **Finite/scarce** shells that create the biggest-to-smallest trading-line
> drama on purpose. Recommend (a) or (b); (c) risks a stuck, unhappy crab a
> 6-year-old can't fix.

## 6. Species plan

**Target roster: 24–28 species** at full build — smaller than terrarium's 30
because the pack leans on absorbed crossovers and because every amphibious
species costs more than a pure swimmer. Composition: ~8 fully aquatic (koi,
archerfish, danios, rainbowfish, guppies as pond fish, a loach), ~6 amphibious
(turtle, 3–4 frogs/toads, newt, mudskipper), ~6 beach inverts (fiddler crab,
land hermit crab, red-claw crab, vampire crab, nerite, thai micro-crab), ~4
land herps/plants-dwellers reused from terrarium (a tree frog, a small skink).
Many are **crossovers** — a pond koi is a legit aquarium fish, a fire-bellied
toad is a legit terrarium herp — so authoring cost is partly amortized.

Below: **8 flagship species** in the exact `freshwater.js` schema, with
paludarium deltas applied consistently:

- `water: 'palud'`.
- `zone`: `'aquatic' | 'beach' | 'land' | 'arboreal'` (where it lives; maps to
  spawn side and Y-clamp).
- `locomotion`: `'swim' | 'amphibious' | 'crawler' | 'climber' | 'hopper'`.
- `landMode`/`waterMode`: present only when `locomotion:'amphibious'`.
- `humidity`: comfort center (drives the derived-humidity readout, §2).
- New optional flags: `basker`, `shellUser`, `metamorph` (id of the adult a
  larva becomes), `spitter` (archerfish).
- Everything else — identical fields, identical types, true-to-life `colors`,
  exactly 3 kid-true `facts`.

### 6.1 The archerfish spit (signature moment)

Cheap version: when a `cricket` (hop food) lands on a branch/leaf **above**
`uWaterY` and an archerfish is within range and hungry, the fish rises to just
below the surface, aims, and emits a **water-jet particle** (reuse the mist/
bubble `Points` system, one short upward streak). On hit, the cricket is
knocked off its perch, falls to the water, becomes a surface-swimmer food item,
and the school races in (existing `nearestFor` congregation). No new physics —
a raycast from fish to food, a particle streak, and a "detach food → drop it"
state change.

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — archerfish spit.** (a) **Full signature moment** —
> aim, jet particle, knockdown, feeding race. It is *the* wow of this pack and
> it's cheap (raycast + reuse the bubble particles). (b) **Cosmetic only** —
> the fish spits at any surface bug ambiently, purely for show, food isn't
> gated on it. (c) **Skip for MVP** — archerfish is a normal fish that eats
> crickets that fall in on their own. Recommend (a): the cost is low and the
> payoff is high, but it's a milestone after the amphibious core lands.

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — the axolotl.** Terrarium already lists the axolotl as a
> `water:'fresh'` crossover that lives in the *aquarium*. It is a far more
> natural paludarium resident (it's aquatic but it's an amphibian). (a) **Leave
> it in the aquarium** as the terrarium tease (no change, no new work). (b)
> **Move it here** as a paludarium species (`water:'palud'`, pure `swim`, deep
> end) — thematically perfect, but re-homes a species and re-points the
> terrarium shop tease. (c) **List it in both** shop tabs, one shared spec — max
> discoverability, slight save/rules bookkeeping. Recommend (a) unless you want
> the paludarium's fish roster to feel more special, then (b).

> **DECISION FOR JOHN — turtles eating tankmates.** Real red-eared sliders eat
> small fish and fry. `predator:true` + `canEat` (0.42 ratio) already means a
> slider will hunt guppies, tadpoles, and small crabs on screen — dramatic and
> true, but a kid may be upset to lose a named koi baby. (a) **Predator on**
> (default, matter-of-fact like the snake feeding in terrarium) — `rules.js`
> already *warns* at purchase. (b) **Herbivore mode toggle** (parent setting,
> mirrors the snake-feeding toggle) — turtle eats only sticks/veg on screen,
> real diet still stated in the facts. (c) **Off** — turtle never predates.
> Recommend the terrarium precedent: **(a) with the parent toggle from (b)**,
> default shown, warned by rules, honest in the facts.

## 7. The four retention mechanics, made concrete

Per HABITAT_VISION every habitat ships all four. Paludarium's advantage is that
**two of them are literally metamorphosis and shell-swapping — growth made
visible** in a way no fish tank can match.

1. **Care debt** — offline decay via `CareSim.applyOffline`, unchanged. One
   tank, water quality + dirty glass (§2), capped at `SIM.OFFLINE_CAP_HOURS`. A
   neglected pond drops water quality, which (via the derived-humidity model)
   also stresses the land species — one lapse hurts both halves, which reads as
   a real, connected ecosystem.
2. **Growth & babies** — three visible growth stories from one `f.growth`
   scalar: (i) **tadpole → frog metamorphosis** (§4.2) — the loudest "my pet
   *changed*" moment in the whole game; (ii) **hermit-crab shell-swaps** (§5) —
   growth you can *see* because the pet visibly moves house; (iii) **koi growth**
   — a bought juvenile koi grows toward its huge adult size over `GROW_DAYS`,
   and a healthy koi pair can spawn fry (livebearer-style breeding path reused).
3. **Collection book** — every paludarium species owned unlocks its card
   (facts, habitat, record size), exactly the existing `discovered` set. Both
   the larva and adult forms (tadpole *and* frog) can be separate cards, so
   raising one through metamorphosis fills two entries — a built-in reason to
   see it through.
4. **Surprises** — unscripted small moments to catch: a turtle hauled out and
   basking that wasn't there this morning; a mudskipper crawled fully onto the
   beach at low activity; the archerfish spit landing a bug; a hermit crab
   caught **out of its shell** mid-swap (rare, vulnerable, memorable); a
   shed/molt left on the beach; the whole fiddler-crab group ducking burrows at
   once when the kid taps the glass.

## 8. Performance budget — S24-class, 60 fps, honest about two halves

This is the pack that renders an aquarium **and** a terrarium in one frame, so
the budget is real and the mitigations matter. Baseline: the live game holds 60
fps with 42 fish + inverts + full aquarium FX on an S24. Paludarium must fit the
*same* budget, not double it.

| Cost center | Aquarium today | Paludarium | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Water surface plane | full footprint | **~60% area** (clipped at the beach, waterline at 40% H) | Smaller mesh, fewer verts; net cheaper than aquarium. |
| Caustics quad | full | **underwater only (~60%)** | Additive screen pass, scaled down. Cheaper. |
| Sun shafts | 5 planes | 5 planes, shorter | ~same. |
| Bubbles / motes | 42 + 220 pts | ~30 + ~160 pts split land/water | Fewer points; the land half doesn't need marine snow. |
| Soil/bank terrain | — (new) | **+1 displaced plane, +leaf litter sprites** | One extra draw call; static, no per-frame cost. |
| Plants/branches decor | reused | aquatic + terrestrial set | Same primitives; keep instance count modest. |
| **World-Y shader mask** | — (new) | **+1 varying, ~8 ALU/fragment** on opted-in materials | The chosen waterline tech (§1.1): single pass, **zero extra draw calls**. This is the whole reason clip planes / a water volume were rejected. |
| Agents | up to 42 | **cap 14–16** | The real lever. Amphibious agents cost more (state machine + two gaits), so the pack caps `maxAgents` well below the aquarium. A paludarium is a *few* charismatic animals (a turtle, a koi pair, some frogs, a crab colony), not a 42-fish shoal — which is also biologically right. |
| Amphibious transition | — | EMERGE/SUBMERGE lerps, a few frames each, rare | Only crossing agents pay it, only during the ~0.3 s crossing. Negligible amortized. |
| Archerfish spit | — | raycast + short particle burst, event-driven | Reuses the bubble `Points`; fires seldom. Cheap. |

**Frame budget verdict:** the two-halves fear is mostly answered by geometry —
the waterline at 40% means neither half is full-size, the water FX shrink to
~60%, and the new terrain is a static plane. The mask adds ALU, not draw calls.
The one place we must be disciplined is **agent count**: cap the pack at ~14–16
active agents (vs 42), which the content design wants anyway. Net: paludarium
targets the *same* frame budget as the live aquarium, not a doubled one. If
profiling on the S24 shows the mask ALU is hot on low-end GPUs, the fallback is
a `#define` that drops the caustic-shimmer term (keeps tint + meniscus) — a
one-line quality tier.

## 9. MVP cut — 8 species, minimum systems

The smallest build that proves the merge: one waterline, one amphibious crosser,
one metamorphosis, one shell-swap, both feeding halves.

| Species | Role | Locomotion | Why in MVP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Koi (×1–2) | pond centerpiece | swim (aquarium reuse) | Proves the underwater half is just the aquarium; growth story; zero new code. |
| Danio or guppy (pond fish) | shoal / life in the water | swim | Cheap water motion, feeding-rush reuse. |
| Mudskipper | **the mascot** | amphibious (swim↔crawl) | Proves the amphibious state machine and the half-submerged mask in one animal. |
| Fire-bellied toad | amphibian | amphibious (swim↔hopper) | Proves hopper reuse across the waterline; forgiving care. |
| Fire-bellied tadpole | the transformation | swim → amphibious | **Proves the metamorphosis builder-swap** — the pack's headline retention beat. |
| Land hermit crab | beach life | climber (terrarium reuse) + shellUser | **Proves the shell-swap system**; zero new movement code. |
| Fiddler crab | beach crowd | crawler (terrarium reuse) | Cheap charm; the group-duck surprise. |
| Red-eared slider | the big amphibian | amphibious (swim↔crawl) + basker | The archetypal "swims then hauls out to bask" moment; sells the whole concept. |

**Systems in MVP:** paludarium environment builder (split terrain + waterline
shader mask + reused water FX), water-quality + dirty-glass meters with derived
humidity (DECISION §2 option a), the `amphibious` locomotion module with
swim/crawl/hopper sub-modes, food behaviors `sink`/`hop`/`float`/`static` with
cross-boundary handling (DECISION §3 option a), the metamorphosis threshold hook
(§4.2), the shell-swap item system + Shell drop tool (§5), and turtle predation
with the parent toggle (DECISION §6 option a+b).

**Deferred:** archerfish spit (§6.1 — its own milestone once the amphibious core
is solid), koi/frog breeding (buy-only tadpoles in MVP, DECISION §4.2 option a),
adjustable water level (DECISION §1 option b), newt and the wider crab/fish
roster (author against `SPECIES_SPEC.md` when the build starts), the axolotl
re-home decision (§6), and branch-perch archerfish targets beyond a single leaf.
